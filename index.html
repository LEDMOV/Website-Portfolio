                Hi, I'm Alfie Corthine, an aspiring computer scientist with a passion for creating solutions to generally stupid & unnecessary problems. Currently an A-level student studying:
            </p>
            <li> Maths, Computer Science, Economics, and BTEC Engineering </li>
            <p>
                I enjoy tackling challenges that involve programming, hardware, and problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interests range from developing websites and apps to experimenting with innovative projects using a Raspberry Pi. I believe in using technology to address real-world problems, whether it's through designing efficient systems or exploring the possibilities of AI.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond academics, I’m always curious to learn new skills, refine my craft, and collaborate on projects that make an impact. This site is a space where I document my journey, achievements, and ideas as I work towards building a future in the tech industry.
